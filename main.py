# TO DO():
# update_score() ,  show_score():
# work on the menu() function !! 'show' the objective of the game ?
# edit draw() to use keys
# add counter, add reset()
# quit game. test quit with powerpoint. edit quit() so that it will not count as a turn
# instead of 'return message()' at the end of a turn(), just 'message()' ?
# messages should only be used for communication, messaging. same in conditions(),  victory(), draw()
# instead of 'return turn()' at the end of a message(), just 'turn()' ?
# why should end() return True ?  !!!IMPORTANT!!!
# is it necessary to return ANYTHING from victory(), draw(), end()? unsure....
# .... maybe only return True in end(), in order to reduce lines
# think of better names for next(). maybe messages? messageZ? messageN?
# delete some comments
# full column
# rename 'KEYBOARDS' to 'COMMANDS' ?
# copy version to date
# backup to replit  https://replit.com/@SavtaSylva/GameFlow#main.py
# what to do next?
